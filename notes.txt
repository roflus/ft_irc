Client heeft nickname max lenght of 9 characters.
    In addition to the nickname, all servers must have the
    following information about all clients: the real name of the host
    that the client is running on, the username of the client on that
    host, and the server to which the client is connected.


Channels names are strings (beginning with a '&' or '#' character) of
   length up to 200 characters.  Apart from the the requirement that the
   first character being either '&' or '#'; the only restriction on a
   channel name is that it may not contain any spaces (' '), a control G
   (^G or ASCII 7), or a comma (',' which is used as a list item
   separator by the protocol).

   To create a new channel or become part of an existing channel, a user
   is required to JOIN the channel.
   If the channel doesn't exist prior to joining, the channel is created and the creating user becomes a
   channel operator.  If the channel already exists, whether or not your
   request to JOIN that channel is honoured depends on the current modes
   of the channel.

The channel operator (also referred to as a "chop" or "chanop") on a
   given channel is considered to 'own' that channel.
   The commands which may only be used by channel operators are:

        KICK    - Eject a client from the channel
        MODE    - Change the channel's mode
        INVITE  - Invite a client to an invite-only channel (mode +i)
        TOPIC   - Change the channel topic in a mode +t channel

    A channel operator is identified by the '@' symbol next to their
    nickname whenever it is associated with a channel (ie replies to the
    NAMES, WHO and WHOIS commands).
